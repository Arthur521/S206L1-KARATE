# README - Tests for a Rick and Morty API using Karate

## Overview

This repository contains a test suite written in [Karate](https://github.com/intuit/karate) for testing the Rick and Morty API. Karate is a powerful open-source tool for testing APIs.

## Requisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have this installed:

- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Karate Installation

If you are new to Karate or need help installing it, I recommend watching this video here [Setting up Karate Framework on IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KOJ12Dbxrk) on YouTube. This tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on how to set up Karate for your projects in Intellij IDEA.
